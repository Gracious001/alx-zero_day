I am by name Edokpa Gracious, a boy born in the year 2000, July 1st. I am from the family of 5. My parents are well to do, so loving and caring. I love technology and I am grateful to ALX for trying to bring out the best in me. Soon I will become a certified and skilled Software Engineer! #DoHardThings!
